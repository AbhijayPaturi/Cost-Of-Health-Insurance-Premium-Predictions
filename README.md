# Cost-Of-Health-Insurance-Premium-Predictions
A multiple linear regression analysis to identify factors that affect and then predict the annual cost of health insurance premium. 

## Description

There are two major componenets to this project in which the cost of annual health insurance premium is predicted based on several key factors.<br>

#### Part I: 
The multiple linear regression analysis was performed via Excel. After doing so, I wrote a paper detailing the steps I took in arriving to my final regression equation (screenshots of each calculation/graph included). I have uploaded the paper as a PDF. 

#### Part II: 
To practice supervised learning using the scikit-learn library, I further expanded upon my initial multiple linear regression analysis. Through this coding approach via Jupyter Notebook, I was able to explore the data more easily, experiment with hyperparameter tuning, score regression results quicker, and further develop my familiarity with the scikit-learn library. Please contact me with any suggestions/improvements!
